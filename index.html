							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I grew up in Utah where I met my wife while going to Utah State university. It was there that I was first introduced to
								programming while studying Electrical Engineering. I then discovered that that was not for me and changed my major to Mechanical
								Engineering. By the time that I discovered my love for web design and development I had already invested around five years
								in engineering.</p>
							<p>I thought to myself what is the best thing to do, start over or just finish up what I am doing? I then discovered that I
								could graduate in one more semester if I changed my major to General Studies in Technology
								<span class="voice">yes this is a real major.</span>So that is what I did. I was hesitant at first because who wants to have a major of "General
								Studies in Technology"? I sure didn 't in my mind I wanted something more useful like Computer Science. But I then discovered
								that it would take me another three years at the university in order to do that.</p>
							<div class="col-xs-12">
								<h3>Big Decisions</h3>
								<p>From there I had some soul searching to do, is it better to get a more prestigious degree or is it better to get out in
									the work force and have three years of experience under my belt. After doing alot of research I decided that it would be
									best to graduate and get experience.</p>
								<p>So from there I started to look for jobs applying for a few and getting turned down. Then something amazing happened ...
									someone contacted me and said that they thought I could be a good fit doing software development. The company is called eIntern
									and I took the job with them. This would give me the real world experience that I need while at the same time I can be paid
									for it.</p>

							<p>My wife and I were married on May 4, 2013 and it has been a great adventure ever since. The day after we got married we
								went off and started selling pest control in Pennsylvania,
								<span class="voice">Not a good idea for a honeymoon,</span>we spent the summer there and then returned to Utah to finish college. She finished
								first and and just in time to have a baby.</p>
